Agenda
How can K-fold cross-validation be used to search for an optimal tuning parameter?
How can this process be made more efficient?
How do you search for multiple tuning parameters at once?
What do you do with those tuning parameters before making real predictions?
How can the computational expense of this process be reduced?
